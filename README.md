## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 20.9 or later
- A Todoist account
- Todoist OAuth integration credentials

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/uncazzy/todoist-dashboard.git
cd todoist-dashboard
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
# or
yarn install
```

3. Set up OAuth and environment variables:

   a. Create a Todoist OAuth integration:
   - Go to [Todoist App Management Console](https://developer.todoist.com/appconsole.html)
   - Create a new app
   - Set your OAuth redirect URI to `http://localhost:3000/api/auth/callback/todoist` (for development)
   - Copy your Client ID and Client Secret

   b. Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory with the following variables:
   ```env
   # Todoist OAuth
   TODOIST_CLIENT_ID=your-todoist-client-id
   TODOIST_CLIENT_SECRET=your-todoist-client-secret
   
   # NextAuth Configuration
   NEXTAUTH_URL=http://localhost:3000
   NEXTAUTH_SECRET=your-nextauth-secret-key
   ```
   Note: Generate a secure NEXTAUTH_SECRET using `openssl rand -base64 32` or another secure method

4. Run the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

5. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser and authenticate with your Todoist account.

### Test Data & Development Mode

For development and testing purposes, you can use dummy data instead of connecting to the Todoist API. This is useful for:
- Testing dashboard features without a Todoist account
- Developing new features with realistic data patterns
- Testing edge cases (overdue tasks, stale tasks, streaks, etc.)
- Performance testing with large datasets

#### Using Fake Data

1. **Generate dummy dataset** (only needed once, or when you want fresh data):
```bash
cd test/scripts
python generate_full_dataset.py --projects 6 --active-tasks 75 --completed-tasks 1500 --months 12
```

2. **Enable dummy data mode** by editing `config/dataSource.ts`:
```typescript
export const USE_DUMMY_DATA = true;  // Change to true
```

3. **Start the development server**:
```bash
npm run dev
```

4. **Switch back to real data** by setting `USE_DUMMY_DATA = false` in `config/dataSource.ts`

#### Test Data Generators

The project includes several test data generators in `/test/scripts`:
- `generate_full_dataset.py`: Generate comprehensive dummy dashboard data (projects, active tasks, completed tasks)
- `generate_recurring_tasks.py`: Generate test data for recurring tasks with various patterns

See [test/README.md](test/README.md) for detailed usage instructions and examples.

### Development Guidelines

- Follow the existing code style and conventions
- Keep code clean and maintainable
- Update documentation as needed
- Keep commits atomic and well-described

## Privacy

Todoist Dashboard respects your privacy. It accesses your Todoist data only with your explicit permission and does not store any personal data or task information beyond the active session. See the [Privacy Policy](https://todoist.azzy.cloud/legal) for more details.

## Security

If you discover any security vulnerabilities, please report them directly to [todoist-dashboard@azzy.cloud](mailto:todoist-dashboard@azzy.cloud). Your efforts in making the project more secure are greatly appreciated.

### Dependency overrides

`package.json` pins one transitive dependency via `overrides`:

| Package | Pin | Reason | Remove when |
|---------|-----|--------|-------------|
| `sharp` | `^0.35.3` | [GHSA-f88m-g3jw-g9cj](https://github.com/lovell/sharp/security/advisories/GHSA-f88m-g3jw-g9cj) — libvips CVEs in the GIF/TIFF/VIPS decoders affect `sharp < 0.35.0`. Next.js pulls `sharp` in as an optional dependency but pins it below `0.35`, so `npm audit fix` cannot resolve this on its own. | A published Next.js release widens its own `sharp` range to `>=0.35`. |

`sharp` is only ever loaded by the Next.js image optimizer, which this project disables outright (`images.unoptimized` in `next.config.js`) since it renders no `<Image>` components. The override is belt-and-braces: it keeps `npm audit` clean and protects against the optimizer being re-enabled later.

Note that `sharp 0.35` requires Node.js >= 20.9, which sets the project's Node floor.
